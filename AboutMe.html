			<h2>My name is hemanth and living the simple life saved my life</h2>
			<p><strong>I used to be a pack rat.</strong> I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.

			<p> Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship. </p>
			<h3 class="about-me-heading">How I turned things around </h3>
			<p> <strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</strong>I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
			<p> It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.</p>
			<h3> Now I live the simple life </h3>
			 <p> Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy. </p>
			 <p>With how much it turned my life around,<strong> I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it,</strong> and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!</p>
